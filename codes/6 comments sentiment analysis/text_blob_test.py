Observation: We can see the output is categorized between two â€” Polarity and Subjectivity.
Polarity is a float value within the range [-1.0 to 1.0] where 0 indicates neutral, +1 indicates a very positive sentiment and -1 represents a very negative sentiment.
Subjectivity is a float value within the range [0.0 to 1.0] where 0.0 is very objective and 1.0 is very subjective. Subjective sentence expresses some personal feelings, views, beliefs, opinions, allegations, desires, beliefs, suspicions, and speculations where as Objective sentences are factual.
